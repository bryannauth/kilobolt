//unit 2
I learned a fair amount from working on the second iteration of the Innovation Project, Unit 2 of the Kilobolt Game Development. For instance, video games utilize a specific type of loop that continually checks for changes (such as movement) and updates the game, also called a game loop. “this” is a very flexible keyword in the Java language. When you need a while loop to run indefinitely just make the condition statement “true”. For a program to pick up individual keystrokes you have to implement the KeyListener superclass.

//unit 3
The ending of the last unit felt pretty unfinished, however the game is now complete. I had the pleasure of learning about parallax scrolling, a technique used for video game graphics, wherin the background images move passed the camera slower than the image(s) in front of it, in order to create the illusion of depth. We didn’t get too in depth (bad um tss) rather, simplified it by having the background (sky/couds) scroll a fifth of the speed of the foreground (ocean/waves).
